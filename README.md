# JavaScript - Homework 2:  Password-Generator
Module 5 Challenge: Password Generator

## Description

Write a JavaScript program that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they’ve selected. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The password must meet the following criteria:

• At least 8 characters but no more than 128.

• Can contain lowercase, uppercase, special, or numeric characters.

• Must contain at least one of the above character types.

• Once all prompts are answered, the password is generated and displayed on the index.html site.

### Tasks completed

* When the page is loaded and the 'Generate Password' button is pressed, the user will be prompted to select password length, and then choose character types. The app will then generate and display a password.
